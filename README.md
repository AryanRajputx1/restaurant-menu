This is a simple Python-based restaurant ordering system that allows users to select items from a predefined menu and calculates the total bill. The program runs in a continuous loop, letting customers add multiple items to their order until they decide to stop by typing "exit". This project is a great way to practice Python basics, including dictionaries, loops, and user input handling.

Features

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Displays the menu clearly with item names and prices.✅ Flexible Ordering – Users can add multiple items until they choose to exit.✅ Real-Time Order Calculation – Automatically updates and displays the total bill.✅ Input Handling – Ensures only valid menu items are added to the order.✅ Lightweight & Fast – Runs in the terminal with no external dependencies.

How It Works

The program displays the restaurant menu with item prices.

Users can enter the name of an item they want to order.

If the item is available, it gets added to their order.

Users can continue adding items or type "exit" to complete their order.

The program then displays the total order amount.
